# Esteban's Beer Machine

Here is the example of a vending machine, this one is for beer which makes it evene better.
We have a 3 column site with login actions, list of products, categories and subcategories, the cart with its functionality and more.

## Why beer :beer:?
I did a beer vending machine for beer with main cateogies and sub categories for different beers around the world. You need to log in to add beers to you cart.

## How can I test this?
[Live Page](http://thebeermachine.meteor.com/)

Here you will find a simple page with no cart, you can navigate around the different categories, once you are ready to buy your beer you will need an account. 

On the top menu you can find the controls to sign in or create your acount. You can use something simple as email: test@test.com, password: testing

Once you are logged in you can start adding beers, of course more than 1, you can remove the items from the list and change the currency, from USD to CRC.

## Technology
* Meteor JS Framework
* Mongo DB
* Boostrap

### How did I use those bad boys?
This is done with a SPA base and functional-reactive programing, if you play around you will see the power of reactivity, once an event is trigger the layout changes and the model itself is refresh without reloading the page.

1- download the git repository
2- https://www.meteor.com/
3- curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
4- cd to the app folder ../themachine
